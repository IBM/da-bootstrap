I asked Bob what language is preferred for tools that Bob executes and the response was

"Python is the recommended language for tools I use.

Key reasons:

Better error handling and debugging
Cross-platform compatibility
Rich ecosystem for JSON/YAML, APIs, and file operations
IBM Cloud Python SDKs available
More maintainable for complex logic
Bash is appropriate for:

Simple file operations
Command chaining
Shell environment setup
Direct CLI tool integration
For new complex tooling or automation, Python is preferred."
