# Automation on IBM Cloud Agent Instructions

## Overview

Existing automation implemented in Terraform is executed locally or on the IBM Cloud.

### Before beginning

- use the Bob mode named DA Developer.
- Do not generate new or modify the existing terraform files.
- Do not analyze all of the folders within the workspace.  If there is more than one folder, first ask which one contains the automation and then only read that one.

### Flow

- Use this guide https://github.com/IBM/da-bootstrap/blob/main/guides/running-existing-terraform-automation.md as the starting point.  Be sure to use
the latest version.
