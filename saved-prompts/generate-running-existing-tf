Create a guide to use with Bob that enables users to run existing terraform automation.
Do not include a section in the guide with instructions for onboarding to the cloud or best practices.
Do not include detailed instructions for the steps.  Those will come later in other guides.

They are starting with a folder that contains terraform files and maybe some additional miscelllaneous files.

The two biggest decisions are 1) where do they want to run it - locally or on the cloud and 2) what kind of automation is it - standard 
terraform or deployable architectures.  A third decision may come later which is whether or not to publish/share the automation which is done
as a catalog offering.

Where do they want to run it.  
1) running locally means using the native Terraform cli commands.  This means that the resulting
terraform state file that keeps track of the automations's deployed resources is also stored locally.  The local method is usually 
preferred when changes are happening quickly as in when it is first being tested, getting the syntax correct, fixing bugs, etc.  Changes to the files
only need to be made locally before running the terrafrom cli to test.  In this case the terraform is not shared.

2) running on the cloud means utilizing the cloud's Schematics service to run Terraform commands.  This results in the state
file being stored on the cloud.  State file on the cloud has the advantage of users of the account 
can use the file and operate on the resources in a somewhat shared manner.  The terraform files are also stored in a Git repository using this 
method.  So changes to the local files also require updating the repository. 

Both local and cloud are valid starting points.

What kind of automation is it.
1) standard terraform is regular terraform.  Standard terrform may be enhanced with advanced features and become a deployable architecture at any time in the 
lifecycle.  This terraform may be ran locally or on the cloud.  Standard terraform ran on the cloud can be done one of two ways.
  a. executed with the Schematics service using a reference to the git repository where the terraform has been stored.
  b. executed with the Schematics as a formal version of an offering in a private catalog on the cloud.

2) deployable architecture is terraform that utilizes advanced features for deployment on the IBM Cloud.  Deployable architectures may only be deployed on 
the cloud and also require the Projects service due to the advanced features of DAs.  A deployable 

Is the automation to be published or shared.
If the automation is to be shared or published with cloud users, then it must be onboarded to a cloud private catalog as an offering.  This decision may be made at any point 
in the development lifecycle.

Generate a guide with a picture that illustrates this decision flow.  Make sure that the diagram shapes do not 
chop off any contained text and that there is a reasonable spacing between the boxes to enhance readability.
